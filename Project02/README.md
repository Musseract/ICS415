# Project02 – ShaderToy GLSL to Unity Shader Converter

## Overview

This Unity project demonstrates how to run a specific ShaderToy shader (written in GLSL) inside a Unity scene.  
The goal is to reproduce the visual effect from ShaderToy directly in Unity, by converting the GLSL code and integrating it as a Unity-compatible shader.
